       "\"We visited this restaurant for dinner during the Vivid Sydney week. Some other Japanese restaurants charged minimum $45 per person during this time, but luckily we found this restaurant which satisfied our cravings for sushi and sashimi.Food: We ordered the blue fin tuna sushi/sashimi platter for two and a drink. The fish was fresh and the sushi taste great. The drink was similar to Starbucks green tea frappucino. But there are a wide variety of sake options and non-alcoholic drinks. Service: We just walked in without knowing that we need to make a reservation during the Vivid Sydney week. The staff was nice and seated us at the bar. The service was quick and friendly.Ambiance: The restaurant is classy and casual. Reservation is recommended especially during weekends and special events. Price: The price is mid-range, not as expensive as other Japanese restaurants. There are wide variety of sushi and sashimi platters, so you can choose the ones that fit your budget.Conclusion: It's an excellent Japanese restaurant not too far from the Opera House. We'll definitely visit again if we are in the area.\""
