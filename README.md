### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to identify the existence of echo chambers within Reddit and understand the characteristics that lead to their formation. The study will use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the prevalence and traits of these echo chambers on Reddit. The topic chosen for this study is ‘Abortion Rights’ due to its controversial nature. This study aims to identify and analyze pro-life as well as pro-choice echo chambers that may have formed on the Reddit forum.

### Results and Discussions

The initial assumption was that the pro-life community would be highly polarized and result in having a majority of echo chambers, as pro-lifers are considered to hold strong and often opposing beliefs about the morality of abortion, with some advocating for a complete ban while others supporting certain exceptions. Additionally, the issue of abortion is often intertwined with political, religious, and ethical considerations, further contributing to the polarization of pro-life perspectives.
On investigating echo chambers within Reddit while focusing on the topic of abortion rights, the results uncovered evidence of highly polarized communities. It was observed that these communities mainly exhibited confirmation bias, where members share and promote information that reinforces their pre-existing beliefs while rejecting information that challenges them.
Moreover, an interesting trend identified is that this bias was especially clear when looking at echo chambers classified as Pro-Choice. The amount of Pro-Life echo chambers found were far less compared to pro-choice echo chambers. Even in posts/communities where members were supporting the Pro-Life movement, the discourse was mixed and couldn’t be classified as an echo chamber. It was observed that pro-choice supporters were more active on the forum and voiced their opinions in larger numbers resulting in more comments as well as echo chambers being classified as pro-choice, which was completely against this study’s initial assumption.

#### Polarization
The observed trend suggests that pro-choice users are more likely to engage with both pro-choice and pro-life communities, indicating a greater willingness to participate in dialogue and consider opposing viewpoints. In contrast, pro-life users appear to primarily communicate with those who share their beliefs, potentially contributing to greater polarization and a lack of understanding of alternative perspectives.
Contrary to intuition, more pro-choice echo chambers were found because the pro-choice community was debating and expressing views within the pro-choice community as well as with the pro-life community. Concurrently, pro-life communities resulted in lesser echo chambers and polarization even though their interaction was primarily with other pro-lifers.

#### Age
Reddit, as a social media platform, appeals to a younger audience. As a general trend, the youth tends to lean towards leftist and liberal political principals, which is in favor of abortion rights. Hence, a huge proportion of Reddit users speak in support of the pro-choice community, which may be the reason for the large number of pro-choice discussions as well as echo chambers as compared to pro-life discussions and echo chambers. 

#### Profanity
During the analysis of the classified comments, it was observed that the extent of the use of profane language was higher in pro-choice comments than in pro-life or neutral comments. This finding conforms to the previous inference that younger people are more likely to be pro-choice, resulting in the formation of more pro-choice echo chambers on Reddit. The prevalence of profanity in pro-choice comments may reflect a cultural shift towards more informal and expressive modes of communication, which is a general trait among younger audiences on online forums. 
However, it is important to note that the use of profanity alone does not necessarily indicate a particular stance on the issue of abortion, and further analysis is needed to better understand the relationship between language use and abortion attitudes
